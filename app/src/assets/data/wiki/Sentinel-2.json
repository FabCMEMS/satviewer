The mission is currently a constellation with two satellites, [[Sentinel-2A]] and [[Sentinel-2B]]; a third satellite, Sentinel-2C, is currently undergoing testing in preparation for launch in 2024.<ref name=\"esa-20210809\">{{cite web |url=https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-2/Gearing_up_for_third_Sentinel-2_satellite |title=Gearing up for third Sentinel-2 satellite |work=[[ESA]] |date=9 August 2021 |access-date=9 August 2021}}</ref>\n\nThe mission supports a broad range of services and applications such as agricultural monitoring, emergencies management, land cover classification or water quality.\n\nSentinel-2 has been developed and is being operated by the [[European Space Agency]], and the satellites were manufactured by a consortium led by [[Airbus Defence and Space]] in Friedrichshafen.\n\n==Overview==\nThe Sentinel-2 mission has the following key characteristics:\n* [[Multispectral image|Multi-spectral]] data with 13 bands in the [[Visible spectrum|visible]], [[Infrared#Regions within the infrared|near infrared]], and [[Infrared#Regions within the infrared|short wave infrared]] part of the [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]]\n* Systematic global coverage of land surfaces from 56°&nbsp;S to 84°&nbsp;N, coastal waters, and all of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]\n* Revisiting every 10 days under the same viewing angles. At high latitudes, Sentinel-2 swath overlap and some regions will be observed twice or more every 10 days, but with different viewing angles.\n* Spatial resolution of 10&nbsp;m, 20&nbsp;m and 60&nbsp;m\n* 290&nbsp;km field of view\n* Free and open data policy\n\nTo achieve frequent revisits and high mission availability, two identical Sentinel-2 satellites (Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B) operate together. The satellites are phased 180 degrees from each other on the same orbit. This allows for what would be a 10-day revisit cycle to be completed in 5 days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2/satellite-description/orbit|title=Orbit - Sentinel 2 - Mission - Sentinel Online|website=sentinel.esa.int|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref> The 290&nbsp;km swath is created by the VNIR and SWIR, which are each made of 12 detectors that are lined in two offset rows.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2/instrument-payload|title=Sentinel-2 - Missions - Instrument Payload - Sentinel Handbook|website=sentinel.esa.int|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref>\n\nThe orbit is [[Sun-synchronous orbit|Sun synchronous]] at {{convert|786|km|mi|abbr=on}} altitude, 14.3 revolutions per day, with a 10:30&nbsp;a.m. descending node. This local time was selected as a compromise between minimizing cloud cover and ensuring suitable Sun illumination.
